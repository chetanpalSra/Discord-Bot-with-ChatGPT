// A Discord bot is a programmed application designed to run on Discord servers to automate tasks, enhance user interaction, or add new functionalities,means act on behalf of user means as another person that act as a user to reply another user that enters message,etc.

// Discord is a communication platform used for text, voice, and video chatting. It allows people to create and join communities called servers.

//Discord Server (Guild)

// A Discord server is a group or community space where people can gather, chat, and share content.

// A server is made up of channels (both text and voice) where users can:
// Chat in text channels (like #general).
// Talk in voice channels (like a group call).
// Share images, links, and other media.
// Each server can be customized with roles (like admin, moderator, member) and permissions that control who can do what within the server.

// Discord is the platform.

// A Discord server is a community space within the platform where users interact with each other.

//A bot client is the program or application you create to interact with Discord's API as a bot It acts as the "identity" of your bot on Discord, allowing it to perform tasks like responding to commands, moderating channels, or delivering notifications.

//A bot client is the program that makes your bot work on Discord. It’s like the brain of the bot—it connects to Discord, listens to what’s happening in a server, and takes action based on the commands or events it sees.

//GatewayIntentBits are like permissions or filters that you set for your Discord bot to control what kind of events it listens to and processes. These are part of Discord's API and help optimize your bot by only giving it access to the specific data it needs.

//Discord servers handle a lot of events, like:
//A user sending a message.
// Someone joining or leaving a server.
// Reactions being added to a message.
// Instead of overwhelming your bot with all these events, GatewayIntentBits let you pick and choose which events your bot cares about. This reduces unnecessary data and keeps your bot efficient.

// Example: How It Works
// Let’s say you’re building a bot that only needs to:

// Respond to messages.
// Greet new members.
// You don’t need to listen for other events like reactions or server updates. So, you’d use the following intents:

// GUILD_MESSAGES for messages in a server.
// GUILD_MEMBERS for detecting when someone joins.

// In Discord, a guild is the technical term for a server. When you join or create a server on Discord, you're actually joining or managing a "guild" in Discord's system.

//A GuildMessages in Discord refers to any message sent in a server's text channel (also called a "guild" in technical terms)

//Log In the Bot: It uses a token (a secret key you get when you create a bot in the Discord Developer Portal) to log the bot into Discord.

// Authenticate: It proves to Discord that the bot is authorized to use the Discord API. Think of the token like a password that tells Discord, "Yes, this bot is allowed to connect."

// Connect to Discord's Servers: Once logged in, the bot connects to Discord's servers so it can start listening to events (like new messages, user joins, etc.) and responding to them.

// Yes, bots make requests to the Discord API to interact with Discord's platform and perform various actions.
